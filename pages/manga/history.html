                        Manga is deeply intertwined with Japanese culture. It
                        covers diverse genres such as romance, sports, fantasy,
                        and more. Initially, it targeted at a Japanese audience,
                        but the manga's popularity has surged in Western
                        countries, owing to its unique art style and compelling
                        narratives. Its history dates back to the 12th and 13th
                        centuries, evolving through various phases like Toba
                        Ehon during the Edo period and gaining recognition in
                        its current form with Rakuten Kitazawa's work in 1876.
                        Post-World War II, manga experienced a significant
                        boost, integrating traditional elements with western
                        themes. Works like Tezuka Osamu’s Astro Boy and anime
                        adaptations like Dragon Ball Z and My Neighbor Totoro
                        contributed to its global appeal. Today, manga is a
                        global phenomenon with diverse genres, influencing anime
                        series and video games, drawing massive audiences
                        worldwide. Popular series like Attack on Titan, Naruto,
                        and One Piece showcase the global impact and continued
                        evolution of manga. In recent years, manga has witnessed
                        significant global growth, becoming exceptionally
                        popular outside Japan. Approximately 40% of the French
                        comic book market is dominated by Japanese manga, and in
                        Germany, 70% of comics sold are manga titles. The United
                        States has also experienced a notable surge in manga
                        popularity, outpacing the mainstream acceptance of
                        Japanese animation or video games in U.S. culture. Large
                        U.S. publishers, such as Viz Media, collaborate with
                        Japanese publishers like Shogakukan and Shueisha to
                        bring manga to American audiences. Although there are
                        fewer manga publishers in Britain, most available titles
                        come from U.S.-based companies like Viz Media and
                        Kodansha Comics. The growth of digital platforms like
                        Amazon Kindle and Comixology has played a crucial role
                        in this global expansion, facilitating easier access to
                        manga for fans worldwide. According to the All Japan
                        Magazin, Book Publisher’s and Editor’s Association
                        (AJPEA), Japan's manga industry earned approximately
                        US$5.77 billion (612.6 billion yen) in 2020, marking a
                        remarkable 23% increase from 2019. This surge in
                        earnings indicates a return to the previous levels of
                        success, with the 1990s marking the peak of manga's
                        popularity before experiencing a resurgence in recent
                        times.
                    </p>
                    <p class="para">The origins of manga are debated among
                        researchers, with some suggesting its presence in the
                        twelfth century due to drawings with manga-like
                        characteristics. However, others view manga as a
                        cultural expression emerging in the early twentieth
                        century. The widespread popularity of manga began in the
                        1980s with Osamu Tezuka's "Astro Boy," where many
                        defining features, including characters with large
                        glistening eyes, originated. Despite being perceived as
                        unique by non-Japanese readers, Tezuka drew inspiration
                        from American cartoons like Betty Boop and early Disney
                        characters. This reciprocal cultural exchange between
                        East and West has been ongoing for decades, influencing
                        various creative works. For instance, Craig McCracken's
                        creation, The Powerpuff Girls, drew from anime
                        references and later saw a reimagined Japanese version
                        called Powerpuff Girls Z.
                    </p>
                    <p class="para">
                        During the 1980s and 1990s, Japanese animation, or
                        anime, had a significant impact in the West, with
                        widespread broadcasting on children's television
                        channels. Nickelodeon stands out as a notable example,
                        featuring Western-produced content with a narrative and
                        aesthetic closely resembling anime. Individuals who were
                        children in the 80s and 90s and are now adults grew up
                        watching influential anime series like Sailor Moon,
                        Dragon Ball, Naruto, and Sakura Cardcaptor. As a result,
                        these shows have left a lasting imprint on the visual
                        aesthetic of this generation.
