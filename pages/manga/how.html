                        effectively at first glance.
                    </p>
                    <h4 class="manga-title">Brainstorming phase</h4>
                    <p class="para">Brainstorm Character Concept: Explore
                        various forms of character brainstorming, utilizing
                        references and inspiration. Understand your character's
                        background, story, posture, and style. Consider details
                        such as fitness level, grooming habits, clothing, and
                        typical activities.
                    </p>
                    <p class="para">Audience Consideration: Understand the
                        demographics of
                        your potential readers, considering age group and
                        interests. Select a genre based on the identified target
                        audience.</p>
                    <p class="para">Demographic Categories: Shonen: Aimed at
                        boys and young teens, focusing on action, adventure, and
                        coming-of-age themes. Shojo: Geared towards teenage
                        girls, covering a wide range from romantic comedies to
                        magical girl stories. Seinen: Targets adult men with
                        mature themes, including horror, science fiction, and
                        action-adventure. Josei: Addresses adult women with
                        mature topics like relationships, career choices, and
                        life drama. Kodomomuke: A subgenre for younger readers,
                        featuring stories about everyday life with child or
                        animal characters.

                    </p>
                    <p class="para">Visualization of the Story: Once the
                        audience and genre are chosen, begin visualizing the
                        story. Ask essential questions such as
                        "What message do I want to convey?" and
                        "How will the characters appear?" Consider what sets
                        your story apart from others in the same genre.
                        Inspiration and Learning: Explore successful stories in
                        your chosen genre for inspiration. Analyze plot and art
                        styles of other successful works to learn valuable
                        lessons. Distinguish your work while drawing insights
                        from existing successes.

                    </p>
                    <h4 class="manga-title">Wireframe phase</h4>
                    <p class="para">Outline Your Story: Begin outlining your
                        manga with plot points and detailed character traits for
                        each scene. Ensure continuity and inclusion of essential
                        details in your story. Consider the smaller panel sizes
                        in manga and plan your story accordingly, focusing on
                        panelling and layouts.</p>
                    <p class="para">Create A Synopsis: Craft a one or
                        two-paragraph synopsis summarizing the story, including
                        key points and plot twists. Use the synopsis as an
                        internal document for organizing the main plot points
                        and maintaining focus during script writing. Keep the
                        synopsis separate from the manga itself, using it as a
                        tool to track and guide the narrative.</p>
                    <p class="para">Create Your Character Profiles: Develop
                        detailed character profiles, including physical
                        appearances, personality traits, and backstories.
                        Understand your characters' motivations as it shapes the
                        plot of your story. Ensure each character has strengths,
                        weaknesses, and, depending on the theme, conveys moral
                        values or a message. Emphasize personification and
                        realism in character development, even if manga drawings
                        are typically exaggerated. Learn body anatomy for
                        realistic poses and expressions, considering references,
                        especially if you are new to manga creation.</p>
                    <p class="para">Write the Script: Focus on writing the story
                        without getting too concerned about graphics and layout.
                        The scripting process involves dialogue and action,
                        ensuring both are present and move the story forward.
                        Write engaging dialogue that is natural, showcases
                        character traits, and advances the plot.</p>
                    <p class="para">Move on to the Storyboard: After the script,
                        create a storyboard that translates the story into a
                        visually pleasing format. Include panel layouts, action
                        scenes, text overlays, sound effects, and other
                        elements. Focus on body language and facial expressions,
                        staying true to your unique manga style. Ensure every
                        scene is necessary and contributes to the overall plot,
                        keeping it concise and clear.</p>
                    <p class="para">Sketch a Wireframe: Once familiar with your
                        character, brainstorm composition by sketching different
                        wireframes. Experiment with poses, movement, and flow
                        without focusing on details initially. Use circles for
                        major features like head, elbows, hands, feet, and
                        knees, a square for the torso, and an inverted triangle
                        for the pelvis. Visualize the wireframe in three
                        dimensions, adding low-detail spheres for circles and
                        creating a more three-dimensional representation. Avoid
                        drawing the character head-on from the front; opt for a
                        three-quarter view for better dimensionality and
                        dynamics.</p>
                    <p class="para">More Tips on Writing Manga: Dedicate ample
                        time and effort to your manga project, considering it as
                        a long-term endeavor. Lack of confidence in drawing is
                        not a hindrance; consider hiring an artist for the
                        panels if needed. Prioritize visual storytelling in
                        manga; translate scripts into eye-catching visuals.
                        Check for grammar and spelling mistakes; have someone
                        proofread your work before publication. Learn from other
                        manga series, observing different artists' approaches to
                        storytelling through visuals.</p>
                    <p class="para">Seek Professional Edits: Despite personal
                        satisfaction, professional edits offer a valuable
                        external perspective. Engage experienced editors,
                        especially those specialized in manga, for unbiased
                        insights on script and artwork improvements. Implement
                        the advice received to enhance your manga before
                        submission or publication.</p>
                    <h4 class="manga-title">Drawing phase</h4>
                    <p class="para">Allow your imagination to roam free in this
                        phase, capturing each scene's momentum on paper. Include
                        inking, toning, and coloring if desired, adding as many
                        details as possible for a professional look. Perform the
                        lettering process, writing dialogue bubbles and sound
                        effects, leaving enough space for these elements. Choose
                        inking techniques like pencils, markers, pens, or
                        digital methods, emphasizing perfection and small
                        details. Maintain consistency in your style across all
                        works and avoid copying others to prevent the perception
                        of plagiarism.</p>
                    <p class="para">Draw Facial Proportions: Construct the basic
                        face using a sphere attached to a cone; draw an eye line
                        one-third from the bottom of the sphere. Create a line
                        of symmetry for eyes, noting that it may not be at the
                        center of the face, especially in a three-quarter view.
                        Draw disproportionately large manga eyes; detail the
                        shape for character expression. Indicate the bottom of
                        the nose with a small circle at the intersection of the
                        sphere and cone. Keep the nose minimal in shape unless a
                        distinctive nose is part of the character design.</p>
                    <p class="para">Add Clothing, Decoration, and Hair: Use the
                        skin layer outline as a guide to draw the character's
                        clothing, ensuring it complements the pose for a dynamic
                        image. Be inventive with clothing design to add interest
                        and convey the character's story. Draw the hair in a
                        larger-than-life manner to enhance dynamism, and make
                        sure it reflects movement and adds direction to the
                        overall composition.</p>
                    <p class="para">Tidy Outlines and Ink Drawing: Create a
                        clean inking layer for outlines, clothes, and exposed
                        skin. Emphasize fine line details like major folds in
                        clothing, key facial features, and patterns. Adjust line
                        thickness based on the image depth; foreground elements
                        should have slightly thicker outlines than background
                        elements.</p>
                    <p class="para">Refine Shading and Color: Shade the image in
                        black and white, noting the location of the light source
                        for realistic shading. If working in color, avoid using
                        black for shading; opt for a deeper version of the color
                        in the light. Refer to photo references if needed to
                        visualize light and shadows accurately.
                    </p>
                    <p class="para">Focus on Specific Details: Contrast
                        minimalistic and highly detailed areas in the manga art
                        style. Concentrate detailed elements in key areas,
                        typically the eyes and face, to make the character more
                        expressive. Select areas of concentrated detail that
                        best represent the character's story for a more
                        impactful portrayal.</p>
