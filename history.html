                Manga is deeply intertwined with Japanese culture. It covers diverse genres such as romance, sports, fantasy, and more. Initially, it targeted at a Japanese audience, but the manga's popularity has surged in Western countries, owing to its unique art style and compelling narratives. Its history dates back to the 12th and 13th centuries, evolving through various phases like Toba Ehon during the Edo period and gaining recognition in its current form with Rakuten Kitazawa's work in 1876.
        Post-World War II, manga experienced a significant boost, integrating traditional elements with western themes. Works like Tezuka Osamu’s Astro Boy and anime adaptations like Dragon Ball Z and My Neighbor Totoro contributed to its global appeal. Today, manga is a global phenomenon with diverse genres, influencing anime series and video games, drawing massive audiences worldwide. Popular series like Attack on Titan, Naruto, and One Piece showcase the global impact and continued evolution of manga.
        In recent years, manga has witnessed significant global growth, becoming exceptionally popular outside Japan. Approximately 40% of the French comic book market is dominated by Japanese manga, and in Germany, 70% of comics sold are manga titles. The United States has also experienced a notable surge in manga popularity, outpacing the mainstream acceptance of Japanese animation or video games in U.S. culture.
        Large U.S. publishers, such as Viz Media, collaborate with Japanese publishers like Shogakukan and Shueisha to bring manga to American audiences. Although there are fewer manga publishers in Britain, most available titles come from U.S.-based companies like Viz Media and Kodansha Comics.
        The growth of digital platforms like Amazon Kindle and Comixology has played a crucial role in this global expansion, facilitating easier access to manga for fans worldwide. According to the All Japan Magazin, Book Publisher’s and Editor’s Association (AJPEA), Japan's manga industry earned approximately US$5.77 billion (612.6 billion yen) in 2020, marking a remarkable 23% increase from 2019. This surge in earnings indicates a return to the previous levels of success, with the 1990s marking the peak of manga's popularity before experiencing a resurgence in recent times.

            <p>The origins of manga are debated among researchers, with some suggesting its presence in the twelfth century due to drawings with manga-like characteristics. 
                However, others view manga as a cultural expression emerging in the early twentieth century. 
                The widespread popularity of manga began in the 1980s with Osamu Tezuka's "Astro Boy," where many defining features, including characters with large glistening eyes, originated. 
                Despite being perceived as unique by non-Japanese readers, Tezuka drew inspiration from American cartoons like Betty Boop and early Disney characters. 
                This reciprocal cultural exchange between East and West has been ongoing for decades, influencing various creative works. 
                For instance, Craig McCracken's creation, The Powerpuff Girls, drew from anime references and later saw a reimagined Japanese version called Powerpuff Girls Z.</p>
        
                <p>During the 1980s and 1990s, Japanese animation, or anime, had a significant impact in the West, with widespread broadcasting on children's television channels. 
                    Nickelodeon stands out as a notable example, featuring Western-produced content with a narrative and aesthetic closely resembling anime. 
                    Individuals who were children in the 80s and 90s and are now adults grew up watching influential anime series like Sailor Moon, Dragon Ball, Naruto, and Sakura Cardcaptor. 
                    As a result, these shows have left a lasting imprint on the visual aesthetic of this generation.
