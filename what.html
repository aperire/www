            The term Manga encompasses comic books and graphic novels, with its name derived from the Japanese words "man" (whimsical or impromptu) and "ga" (pictures). 
            
            </p>
            <p>Manga was an originally a broad term encompassing various forms of Japanese cartooning, comics, and animation, is now widely recognized as a distinct style of Japanese comic books and graphic novels. 
                Covering diverse genres, including action, romance, and fantasy, manga caters to a broad audience and stands as part of the global comic world alongside American and European graphic novels. 
                While each style has unique storytelling and artistic rules, manga is globally iconic for its black-and-white drawings, large expressive eyes, dynamic action scenes with speed lines and onomatopoeia. 
                Unlike Western comics, manga is typically published in black and white due to its frequent release schedule, and readers engage from right to left, following the traditional Japanese reading style. 
                What sets manga apart is not only its unique artwork but also its ability to explore deep character development and intricate plots, often spanning numerous volumes.
