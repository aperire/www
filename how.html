         The goal is to convey a compelling blend of style and story, ensuring that the character communicates effectively at first glance.
      <p> &nbsp;
      <h5>
         Brainstorming phase
      </h5>
      <p>
         Brainstorm Character Concept:
         Explore various forms of character brainstorming, utilizing references and inspiration.
         Understand your character's background, story, posture, and style.
         Consider details such as fitness level, grooming habits, clothing, and typical activities.</p> 
      <p>    Audience Consideration:
         Understand the demographics of your potential readers, considering age group and interests.
         Select a genre based on the identified target audience.</p>   
         
      <p>     Demographic Categories:
         Shonen: Aimed at boys and young teens, focusing on action, adventure, and coming-of-age themes.
         Shojo: Geared towards teenage girls, covering a wide range from romantic comedies to magical girl stories.
         Seinen: Targets adult men with mature themes, including horror, science fiction, and action-adventure.
         Josei: Addresses adult women with mature topics like relationships, career choices, and life drama.
         Kodomomuke: A subgenre for younger readers, featuring stories about everyday life with child or animal characters.</p> 
         
      <p>    Visualization of the Story:
         Once the audience and genre are chosen, begin visualizing the story.
         Ask essential questions such as "What message do I want to convey?" and "How will the characters appear?"
         Consider what sets your story apart from others in the same genre.
         Inspiration and Learning:
         Explore successful stories in your chosen genre for inspiration.
         Analyze plot and art styles of other successful works to learn valuable lessons.
         Distinguish your work while drawing insights from existing successes.</p> &nbsp; &nbsp; 
         
      <h5>
            Wireframe phase
      </h5>

         <p>  Outline Your Story:
         Begin outlining your manga with plot points and detailed character traits for each scene.
         Ensure continuity and inclusion of essential details in your story.
         Consider the smaller panel sizes in manga and plan your story accordingly, focusing on panelling and layouts.</p>  
         
         <p>  Create A Synopsis:
         Craft a one or two-paragraph synopsis summarizing the story, including key points and plot twists.
         Use the synopsis as an internal document for organizing the main plot points and maintaining focus during script writing.
         Keep the synopsis separate from the manga itself, using it as a tool to track and guide the narrative. </p>  
         
         <p>   Create Your Character Profiles:
         Develop detailed character profiles, including physical appearances, personality traits, and backstories.
         Understand your characters' motivations as it shapes the plot of your story.
         Ensure each character has strengths, weaknesses, and, depending on the theme, conveys moral values or a message.
         Emphasize personification and realism in character development, even if manga drawings are typically exaggerated.
         Learn body anatomy for realistic poses and expressions, considering references, especially if you are new to manga creation.</p> 
         
         <p>   Write the Script:
         Focus on writing the story without getting too concerned about graphics and layout.
         The scripting process involves dialogue and action, ensuring both are present and move the story forward.
         Write engaging dialogue that is natural, showcases character traits, and advances the plot. </p> 
         
         <p>   Move on to the Storyboard:
         After the script, create a storyboard that translates the story into a visually pleasing format.
         Include panel layouts, action scenes, text overlays, sound effects, and other elements.
         Focus on body language and facial expressions, staying true to your unique manga style.
         Ensure every scene is necessary and contributes to the overall plot, keeping it concise and clear.</p>  
         
         <p> Sketch a Wireframe:
            Once familiar with your character, brainstorm composition by sketching different wireframes.
            Experiment with poses, movement, and flow without focusing on details initially.
            Use circles for major features like head, elbows, hands, feet, and knees, a square for the torso, and an inverted triangle for the pelvis.
            Visualize the wireframe in three dimensions, adding low-detail spheres for circles and creating a more three-dimensional representation.
            Avoid drawing the character head-on from the front; opt for a three-quarter view for better dimensionality and dynamics. </p> 
            
         <p>  More Tips on Writing Manga:
            Dedicate ample time and effort to your manga project, considering it as a long-term endeavor.
            Lack of confidence in drawing is not a hindrance; consider hiring an artist for the panels if needed.
            Prioritize visual storytelling in manga; translate scripts into eye-catching visuals.
            Check for grammar and spelling mistakes; have someone proofread your work before publication.
            Learn from other manga series, observing different artists' approaches to storytelling through visuals.</p>  
   
         <p>   Seek Professional Edits:
            Despite personal satisfaction, professional edits offer a valuable external perspective.
            Engage experienced editors, especially those specialized in manga, for unbiased insights on script and artwork improvements.
            Implement the advice received to enhance your manga before submission or publication.</p> &nbsp; &nbsp;
   
      <h5>
         Drawing phase
      </h5>

         <p> 
         Allow your imagination to roam free in this phase, capturing each scene's momentum on paper.
         Include inking, toning, and coloring if desired, adding as many details as possible for a professional look.
         Perform the lettering process, writing dialogue bubbles and sound effects, leaving enough space for these elements.
         Choose inking techniques like pencils, markers, pens, or digital methods, emphasizing perfection and small details.
         Maintain consistency in your style across all works and avoid copying others to prevent the perception of plagiarism.</p> 
                        
         <p>   Draw Facial Proportions:
         Construct the basic face using a sphere attached to a cone; draw an eye line one-third from the bottom of the sphere.
         Create a line of symmetry for eyes, noting that it may not be at the center of the face, especially in a three-quarter view.
         Draw disproportionately large manga eyes; detail the shape for character expression.
         Indicate the bottom of the nose with a small circle at the intersection of the sphere and cone.
         Keep the nose minimal in shape unless a distinctive nose is part of the character design.</p> 

         <p>  Add Clothing, Decoration, and Hair:
         Use the skin layer outline as a guide to draw the character's clothing, ensuring it complements the pose for a dynamic image.
         Be inventive with clothing design to add interest and convey the character's story.
         Draw the hair in a larger-than-life manner to enhance dynamism, and make sure it reflects movement and adds direction to the overall composition. </p>  
         
         <p>  Tidy Outlines and Ink Drawing:
         Create a clean inking layer for outlines, clothes, and exposed skin.
         Emphasize fine line details like major folds in clothing, key facial features, and patterns.
         Adjust line thickness based on the image depth; foreground elements should have slightly thicker outlines than background elements.</p> 
         
         <p>   Refine Shading and Color:
         Shade the image in black and white, noting the location of the light source for realistic shading.
         If working in color, avoid using black for shading; opt for a deeper version of the color in the light.
         Refer to photo references if needed to visualize light and shadows accurately.</p> 
         
         <p> Focus on Specific Details:
         Contrast minimalistic and highly detailed areas in the manga art style.
         Concentrate detailed elements in key areas, typically the eyes and face, to make the character more expressive.
         Select areas of concentrated detail that best represent the character's story for a more impactful portrayal.</p>   &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;
