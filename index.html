		<h1>All about starting to draw a manga</h1>
		<h2>Starter kit for you!</h2>
			<p>Hello world, this is the website of learning how to start drawing a manga. The website title, 'Be an Amateur' literally means to become an amateur! Amateur is a french word for a lover. I made this website for people who love manga and are engaged to start drawing manga but don't know how. </p>
